# RNA 3D Structure Analysis Report

## Overview
This report contains comprehensive analysis of RNA sequences and structures,
designed to inform the development of groundbreaking RNA 3D structure prediction models.

## Key Findings
- Dataset contains very long sequences (>1000 nt), requiring special handling.
- High variability in sequence lengths suggests need for adaptive architectures.

## Modeling Recommendations
- Use hierarchical architecture to handle variable sequence lengths.
- Implement sequence embedding that captures nucleotide context.
- Implement multi-scale representation of RNA structures.
- Integrate evolutionary information through MSA features.
- Use uncertainty quantification to generate ensemble predictions.

## Directory Structure
- `sequence_analysis/`: Analysis of RNA sequences
- `structure_analysis/`: Analysis of RNA 3D structures
- `comprehensive_report.json`: Complete analysis results in JSON format

## Next Steps
1. Implement baseline models using the recommended architectures
2. Analyze MSA data to incorporate evolutionary information
3. Develop physics-informed neural network layers
4. Create multi-scale representation of RNA structures
